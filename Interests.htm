    <h1> My Interests</h1>
    <a href= "index.htm"> Go back to Index</a>
    <p> My three interests are <a href= "#anchor1">Music</a>,<a href= "#anchor2"> Intraday Trading</a>, and <a href="#anchor3">Playing games</a></p>
    <!-- I will describe the three interests ahead -->
    <h2 id="anchor1"> Music </h2>
    <p> I love playing the guitar and singing. I often host jam sessions with my friends where we get together under a bonfire where we sing and play together, while even trying to create our own music.</p>
    <h2 id="anchor2"> Day trading</h2>
    <p> During the last summer, the stock market was touching new heights after the Covid-19 downfall. With a lot of free time in hand, I decided to learn and apply trading strategies. It resulted in a 15% profit on my invested money of &#8377; 100,000.</p>
    <h2 id="anchor3"> Playing card games and board games</h2>

    <p class = "bord"> My friends call me the Monopoly king! I love playing games like Catan, Clue, and Poker among many others.</p>
